| [Big cities music](a_basic_python) | Comparison of user preferences on Yandex.Music between Moscow and Saint Petersburg depending on the time of day (morning and evening) and day of the week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)| Python, Pandas |
| Study on borrowers' Reliability | Customer - the credit department of a bank. It is necessary to investigate whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the timely repayment of the loan. The input data from the bank is statistics on the creditworthiness of clients. The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to repay the loan to the bank.| Python, Pandas |
| The study of apartment sale listings | The available data from the Yandex Real Estate service comprises an archive of apartment sale listings in St. Petersburg and neighboring areas over several years. The goal is to learn how to determine the market value of real estate properties. Our task is to establish parameters that will enable the construction of an automated system capable of detecting anomalies and fraudulent activities.| Python, Pandas, Random, Matplotlib, Numpy |
| Research on Russian cinema distribution data | Customer of the research: The Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation. The goal is to study the Russian film market and identify current trends. Special attention should be given to films that have received government support. An attempt should be made to answer the question of how interesting such films are to the audience. We will work with data published on the open data portal of the Ministry of Culture. The dataset contains information about film distribution certificates, box office earnings, government support for films, as well as information from the Kinopoisk website.| Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib |
| Determining a prospective tariff plan for a telecom company | In the "Megaline" company, a federal mobile operator, customers are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra." To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff plan brings in more money. A preliminary analysis of the tariffs on a small sample of customers is required. Data on 500 "Megaline" users is available: who they are, where they are from, which tariff plan they use, and how many calls and messages each sent in 2018. It is necessary to analyze customer behavior and make a conclusion - which tariff is better (for the company).| Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib |
| Tariff Recommendation | The mobile operator "Megaline" has found out that many customers are using outdated tariff plans. They want to build a system capable of analyzing customer behavior and suggesting a new tariff: "Smart" or "Ultra". We have data on the behavior of customers who have already switched to these tariffs (from the "Statistical Data Analysis" course project). We need to build a classification model that will select the appropriate tariff. Data preprocessing is not required - we have already done it. The goal is to build a model with the highest possible accuracy, aiming for an accuracy of at least 0.75. You need to independently verify the accuracy on the test dataset.| Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Sklearn |
| Customer churn | "Beta-Bank" has started losing customers. Every month. Not a lot, but it's noticeable. Bank marketers have calculated that retaining current customers is cheaper than attracting new ones. The task is to forecast whether a customer will leave the bank in the near future. Historical data on customer behavior and contract terminations with the bank have been provided. Build a model with the highest possible F1-score. To pass the project successfully, the F1-score needs to be brought up to 0.59. Check the F1-score on the test dataset independently. Additionally, measure the AUC-ROC, and compare its value with the F1-score.| Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn |
| Choosing a location for an oil well | The task from the extraction company "X" is to decide where to drill a new oil well. We have samples of oil in three regions: in each region, there are 10,000 oil fields where the quality of the oil and the volume of its reserves were measured. The goal is to build a machine learning model that will help determine the region where extraction will bring the highest profit. Additionally, we need to analyze the potential profit and risks using the Bootstrap method.| Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn |
| Customer Churn Prediction in the "Just Like Home" Hotel Chain | The customer of this research is the "Just Like Home" hotel chain. In order to attract customers, this hotel chain has added the option to book a room on their website without prepayment. However, if a customer cancels the reservation, the company incurs losses. Hotel staff could, for example, purchase products for the guest's arrival or simply fail to find another customer in time. To address this issue, you need to develop a system that predicts reservation cancellations. If the model predicts that the reservation will be canceled, the customer is offered to make a deposit. The deposit amount is 80% of the cost of the room for one day and the cost of one-time cleaning. The money will be deducted from the customer's account if they do cancel the reservation.| Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn |
| Prediction of housing prices | In this project, we need to train a linear regression model on housing data in California in 1990. Based on the data, we need to predict the median house value in a residential area. Let's train the model and make predictions on the test set. We will evaluate the model's performance using the RMSE, MAE, and R2 metrics.| Python, Pandas, Numpy, Pyspark, Seaborn |
| Protection of client personal data | The data of the clients of the insurance company 'Even if Flood' should be protected. Develop a method of data transformation in such a way that it is difficult to reconstruct personal information from it. Justify the correctness of its operation. It is necessary to protect the data so that the quality of machine learning models does not deteriorate during the transformation. It is not necessary to select the best model. | Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn |
| Car Valuation | A used car sales service 'Not damaged, not repainted' is developing an application to attract new clients. In it, users can quickly determine the market value of their car.
