# Study on borrowers' Reliability

## Project description 
Customer - the credit department of a bank. It is necessary to investigate whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the timely repayment of the loan. The input data from the bank is statistics on the creditworthiness of clients. The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to repay the loan to the bank.

## Key Findings
1) The number of children directly affects the timely repayment of the loan.

2) The highest number of loan defaults occurs among married couples. The second-highest in terms of default are individuals in civil partnerships. The third-highest in terms of debt are individuals who are single.

3) The majority of debtors are individuals with moderate incomes. A clear linear relationship is observed, as there are very few individuals with extremely high or extremely low incomes who owe money to the bank.

4) Most borrowers are individuals involved in real estate transactions, specifically buying apartments, renovating them, building houses, etc. Second in terms of loans are individuals buying automobiles. Similarly, individuals investing in education rank third in terms of loans.
