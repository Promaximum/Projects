## Tools & Skills
* Python
* Pandas

## Key Findings
The day of the week affects user activity differently in Moscow and Saint Petersburg.

Musical preferences do not vary much throughout the week, whether it's Moscow or Saint Petersburg. Slight differences are noticeable at the beginning of the week, particularly on Mondays:
In Moscow, users listen to "world" music genre, while in Saint Petersburg, it's jazz and classical.

There are more similarities than differences in the tastes of users in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Contrary to expectations, genre preferences in Saint Petersburg resemble those in Moscow.
