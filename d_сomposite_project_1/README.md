# Research on Russian cinema distribution data

## Project description 
Customer of the research: The Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation. The goal is to study the Russian film market and identify current trends. Special attention should be given to films that have received government support. An attempt should be made to answer the question of how interesting such films are to the audience. We will work with data published on the open data portal of the Ministry of Culture. The dataset contains information about film distribution certificates, box office earnings, government support for films, as well as information from the Kinopoisk website.

## Key Findings
1) During the exploratory data analysis, we found that until 2015, there were relatively few films shown, although their number was increasing, and their share varied from 10% to 30%. The highest number of films was shown in 2019, although their share in the overall cinema screening rating is not at the top. The maximum box office earnings were in 2017. The minimum box office earnings were in the years 2010-2013. This is indicated by both the average and median lines.
We found that there is a large dispersion in the data, reflected in the difference between the mean and median values. We observe a situation where there are very low box office earnings for some movies and extremely high earnings for others. It was also revealed that in almost all years except 2015, films for audiences aged 16+ are the most popular.

2) During the investigation of films that received government support, it was noted that most of these films do not break even, however, films with average ratings can bring in significant profits. The most funded genres turned out to be drama, comedy, and animation. Fyodor Bondarchuk earned the most, having directed only two films with average ratings. The most profitable director was K. Shipenko.
