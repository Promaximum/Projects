# Project: "Assessment of the risk of road traffic accidents along the selected route"

## Project description 
An order to create a system that could assess the risk of road traffic accidents along a selected route was received.

## Tools & Skills
* Python
* SQL
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Sqlalchemy
* Sklearn
* Catboost
* Calendar
* Optuna

## Key Findings

During the execution of the composite project, the following tasks were accomplished:

1) Loaded SQL tables.
2) Conducted initial exploration of the tables.
3) Performed statistical analysis of road traffic accident (RTA) factors.
4) Created a model for assessing driver risk.
5) Analyzed the importance of RTA factors.
6) Identified and evaluated the best-performing model, which turned out to be a decision tree model with an F1 score of 0.665457 on the test dataset.
7) Drew conclusions from the model and provided recommendations for further research.
